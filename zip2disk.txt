ZIP2DISK(1)                                           ZIP2DISK(1)



NAME
       zip2disk - Commodore 1541 ZipCode extractor

SYNOPSIS
       zip2disk  zipcodefile [ imagefile.d64 ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the zip2disk command.

       The  Commodore 1541 disk archiver ZipCode was developed in
       order to make it possible to  transfer  disk  images  over
       modem  lines.  Nowadays it is better to use gzip(1) on the
       disk images.  The zip2disk command can be used to  convert
       ZipCode archives to 1541 disk images.

SECURITY
       The  ZipCode  file names must be prefixed with the strings
       1!, 2!, 3!, and 4!, just like ZipCode works  on  the  Com­
       modore  64.   Some  Unix shells treat the character ! spe­
       cially.  To avoid unpleasant situations, please  refer  to
       the documentation of the shell you are using.

BUGS
       The  sector-level  disk  identifier  stored in the ZipCode
       files is not included in the disk image.

AUTHOR
       The zip2disk utility was originally written by Paul  David
       Doherty.   It  was  improved  and packaged by Marko Mäkelä
       <marko.makela@nic.funet.fi>.
