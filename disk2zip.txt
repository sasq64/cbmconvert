DISK2ZIP(1)                                           DISK2ZIP(1)



NAME
       disk2zip - Commodore 1541 ZipCode compressor

SYNOPSIS
       disk2zip [options] imagefile.d64 [ zipcodefile ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the disk2zip command.

       The  Commodore 1541 disk archiver ZipCode was developed in
       order to make it possible to  transfer  disk  images  over
       modem  lines.  Nowadays it is better to use gzip(1) on the
       disk images.  The disk2zip command is provided mainly  for
       historical  reasons, as a replacement for the ZipCode com­
       pressor.

OPTIONS
       disk2zip follows the usual Unix command line syntax,  with
       options starting with a dash (`-').

       --     Stop  processing  options.   This  is useful if the
              first file name argument begins with a dash.

       -iiidd Use 0xii 0xdd (hexadecimal) as the disk identifier.
              The default is 0x36 0x34, or `64'.

SECURITY
       The  names  of the created ZipCode files are prefixed with
       the strings 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4!, just like ZipCode works on
       the  Commodore 64.  Some Unix shells treat the character !
       specially.  To avoid unpleasant situations,  please  refer
       to the documentation of the shell you are using.

AUTHOR
       The disk2zip utility was designed and implemented by Marko
       Mäkelä <marko.makela@nic.funet.fi>.
